# Introduction

Pizzeria is a SvelteKit app that allows users to order their favorite dishes. The app also
includes an in-depth admin panel for the restaurant owners to manage their orders, dishes and
users. The app is made with 0 API routes and only uses form actions and the new Svelte runes.

## Tech Stack

- SvelteKit
- PostgreSQL
- TailwindCSS
- Typescript & Zod
- Drizzle

## Features

- <b>Customize Profile</b> <br>

Users can edit their profile and upload a profile picture.

- <b>Admin Dashboard</b><br>

Admins have a dashboard which they can add/edit or remove dishes,users and check their orders.
Currently, there is no way for you to test this so here are some images of the admin panel. Maybe
I can add a demo account with fake_admin privileges in the future.

- <b>Writing Pure SQL with Drizzle</b> <br>

While Drizzle has its own ORM, I decided to write my own SQL queries for the project to have a
better understanding of the database and to have more control over the queries.

- <b>JWT Authentication</b> <br>
